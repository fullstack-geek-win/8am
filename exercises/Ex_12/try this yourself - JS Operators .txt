Operators in JavaScript:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - Addition (+): Adds two numbers or concatenates two strings.
   - Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
   - Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
   - Division (/): Divides one number by another.
   - Modulo (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.
   - Increment (++): Increases the value of a variable by 1.
   - Decrement (--): Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

2. Assignment Operators:
   - Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.
   - Addition assignment (+=): Adds and assigns a value to a variable.
   - Subtraction assignment (-=): Subtracts and assigns a value to a variable.
   - Multiplication assignment (*=): Multiplies and assigns a value to a variable.
   - Division assignment (/=): Divides and assigns a value to a variable.
   - Modulo assignment (%=): Calculates the modulo and assigns a value to a variable.

3. Comparison Operators:
   - Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
   - Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
   - Strict equal to (===): Checks if two values are equal in value and type.
   - Strict not equal to (!==): Checks if two values are not equal in value or type.
   - Greater than (>): Checks if one value is greater than another.
   - Less than (<): Checks if one value is less than another.
   - Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.
   - Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.

4. Logical Operators:
   - Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
   - Logical OR (||): Returns true if either operand is true.
   - Logical NOT (!): Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand.

5. String Operators:
   - Concatenation (+): Concatenates two strings.

6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
   - Ternary operator (condition ? expr1 : expr2): Evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on the result.

These are some of the most commonly used operators in JavaScript. 
Understanding these operators will help you perform various operations and calculations in your JavaScript programs.
