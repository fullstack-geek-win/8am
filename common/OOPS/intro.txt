OOPS in Javascript(Object Oriented Programming system)

Clean Code separation
Re-usability
Stability
Testability

Classes & Objects
-----------------
Classes consist Member variable & member functions
        name1.length // member variable
        name1.trim() // member function
		
Objects -> implementation

Oracle -> DB
C++ - 100% OOPS
Java - 100% OOPS
Microsoft
Visual Basic programming driven -> event based
C# 2000 - 100%

            constructor(make, model) {
                this.make = make;
                this.model = model;
            }

            drive() {
                console.log("The car is driving.");
            }
			
			        const myCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic");
        myCar.drive(); // Output: The car is driving.
